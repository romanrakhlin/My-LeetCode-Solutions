# My-LeetCode-Solutions

Here I'm gonna store all LeetCode questions I've done.
I started solving LeetCode in August of 2021.
BTW, I'm not consistant at all!! So I can skip days, even weeks! Therefore I'm creating this repository, that everyone can see my progress.
My main goal is to improve my skills as a Software Engineer, master all Data Structures, Algorithms and their use cases, to be an expert in Computer Science, also improve my Python skills.
Another goal is to prepare for interviews which someday I'm gonna face, and to be ready!

## Colaboration

If you wanna prepare for coding interviews with me, DM me and I'll list your repo with LeetCode problems below:
- Nobody

## PS

Also, not that long ago, I made an <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/leetstats-leetcode-analytics/id1590820002">app</a> that helps to keep track of the progress on LeetCode :)
